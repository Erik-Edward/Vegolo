# Vegolo ðŸ¦Ž

A mobile app that helps users identify whether products are vegan by scanning ingredient lists with AI-powered camera analysis.

## Overview

Vegolo uses on-device AI and OCR to provide instant feedback on whether a product is vegan-friendly. Simply point your camera at an ingredient list, and our chameleon mascot will guide you with real-time analysis.

### Key Features

- **Real-time scanning**: Instant ingredient analysis using your camera
- **Offline-first**: Works without internet connection
- **AI-powered**: Uses Google Gemma 3n for intelligent ingredient recognition
- **Multi-language support**: OCR supports 50+ languages
- **Scan history**: Keep track of your past scans with visual thumbnails
- **Trust & transparency**: Clear explanations and confidence scores

### The Mascot

Our friendly chameleon (with glasses!) changes color based on analysis results:
- ðŸŸ¢ Green = Vegan
- ðŸ”´ Red = Non-vegan
- ðŸŸ¡ Yellow = Uncertain

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Flutter (iOS & Android)
- **AI/ML**: Google Gemma 3n via TensorFlow Lite
- **OCR**: Google ML Kit (offline)
- **State Management**: BLoC pattern
- **Database**: SQLite with drift
- **Architecture**: Clean Architecture with feature-based structure

## Development Status

Currently in **Phase 1 (MVP)** - building core functionality with camera integration, OCR, and rule-based vegan detection.

### Roadmap

- âœ… Phase 0: Research & prototyping
- ðŸš§ Phase 1: MVP with camera + OCR + basic detection
