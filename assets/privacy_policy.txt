Vegolo Telemetry & Analytics Policy

Vegolo is designed as an offline-first app. Telemetry remains optional and
privacy-preserving. This policy summarises what we collect, when, and how users
stay in control.

Data Collected (Telemetry Opt-in)
--------------------------------
When you enable “Share anonymous Gemma telemetry” in Settings, Vegolo may upload
aggregated runtime metrics. No ingredient text, OCR content, images, or personal
identifiers are transmitted.

• variant – Gemma model variant selected for the device
• status – outcome of each inference (success, timeout, cancelled, error, parse_failure)
• prompt_length – number of characters in the sanitized prompt
• response_length – number of characters returned by Gemma
• ttft_ms – time-to-first-token in milliseconds
• latency_ms – total inference latency in milliseconds
• finish_reason – optional finish reason reported by the runtime
• totals.* – aggregated counters and rolling averages for the metrics above

User Controls
-------------
• Opt-in toggle lives at Settings → “Share anonymous telemetry.” Disabled by default.
• Opting out stops further uploads immediately.
• Offline mode respects your choice; nothing is queued when you are offline or opt out.
• Clearing the app’s data (or uninstalling) removes any locally cached telemetry state.

Retention & Use
---------------
• Telemetry is used to monitor performance and reliability.
• No data is used for advertising or user profiling.
• Access is limited to Vegolo engineering and QA for debugging trends.
• Raw telemetry is retained for at most 180 days before being rolled into anonymised trend reports.

Security & Compliance
---------------------
• Telemetry uploads use HTTPS (TLS 1.2+).
• Deploy exporters to infrastructure that meets GDPR/CCPA obligations where applicable.
• Changes to the telemetry payload or retention policy are documented here and surfaced in-app.
